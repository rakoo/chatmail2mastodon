## User Guide

To log in with OAuth, send a message to the bot:

```
/login mastodon.social
```

replace "mastodon.social" with your instance, the bot will reply with an URL that you should open to grant access to your account, copy the code you will receive and send it to the bot.

To log in with your user and password directly(not recommended):

```
/login mastodon.social me@example.com myPassw0rd
```

Once you log in, A "Home" and "Notifications" chats will appear, in the Home chat you will receive your Home timeline and any message you send there will be published on Mastodon. In the Notifications chat you will receive all the notifications for your account.

If someone sends you a direct message in a private 1:1 conversation, it will be shown as a new chat where you can chat in private with that person, to start a private chat with some Mastodon user, send:

```
/dm friend@example.com
```

and the chat with "friend@example.com" will pop up.

You can follow hashtags and group of hashtags. To do that:

1. Create a group with the bot
2. Set the name of the group with the hashtags you want to follow separated by a space, for example "#deltachat #chatmail"
3. Send a message to send the group creation to the bot.

The bot will set the group avatar to the same as the "Home" and "Notifications" avatar. Every message that matches any of the hashtags will be sent in the group. To follow other hashtags you can modify the name or create other groups. To stop any following in a chat, just leave the chat.

To logout from your account:

```
/logout
```

For more info and all the available commands(follow, block, mute, etc), send this message to the bot:

```
/help
